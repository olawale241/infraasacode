Follow along with the [Learn guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/modules/modules-overview) at HashiCorp Learn.

To use this modules , you can need to clone the whole code or pull the code 
1,

Initiate the terraform module in the diirectory of the code 
#terraform init 

3,
We need to run the terraform plan to look out for any error or complains from our terraform codes. Correct any error displayed or at best make it conform to the state you want your infrastructure to be.

# terraform plan

Then apply the modules to build your infrastructure of choice 
# terraform apply

After the infrastructure has been used , you may destroy 

# terraform destroy
